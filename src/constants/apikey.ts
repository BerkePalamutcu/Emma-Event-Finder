/* I normally would like to use environemnt variables
    but for react native i need to add more packages to configure that,
    like dotenv, react-native-dotenv and types of dotenv. Therefore,
    since the project is minimal i defined it here. But in big projects I don't do it like that
    absolutely. All environment variables must be kept in .env file
